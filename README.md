# Adoptii-animale
"Salvati inimi patrupede" is a Romanian-language website dedicated to pet adoptions. I built this project using a combination of HTML and CSS to ensure a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience. The website encompasses four fundamental sections:

Homepage: It provides a warm introduction to the website's mission, offers quick links to the adoption page, and includes a section of information for users who want to support the cause.

Adoption Page: The heart of the website, it is a comprehensive resource for those considering adding a furry family member. Here, visitors can browse through a curated selection of cats and dogs eagerly awaiting their forever homes.

About Us: On the "About Us" page, I share the heartwarming story of how "Salvati inimi patrupede" came into existence. Visitors can learn more about the story behind it. It's a testament to my passion and dedication to this cause.

Contact: The 'Contact' page provides individuals with a way to get in touch regarding pet adoption through a contact form.

Throughout the website, I have meticulously curated relevant and engaging content, selecting images and information that showcase the personality and unique traits of each pet.
